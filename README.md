## Getting Started
### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

npm install
```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at http://localhost:8000/#!/templates.

I started the development using angular seed, which gives me a basic layout of the file structure.
For the front end I used Bootstrap to make everything responsive.
Index.html adding in another html file gives a good extendability to the application.
After getting the data, I parse the data and load all the information into an bootstrap table.
